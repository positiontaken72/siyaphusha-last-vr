Page 4: Our Story & Vision
How We Began
Our story is not complicated. Two partners with deep industry experience saw a need for a contractor who did things properly. In 2020 we established Siyaphusha in Phola. We built the company on a foundation of hands on knowledge. We believe the best way to run a project is to understand the work from the ground up.

Where We Are Headed
Our vision is clear. We want to be the first company mining and civil clients think of when they need work done. They should think of us not because we are the largest but because we are the most dependable. We aim to build partnerships that last for years, not just for one project.

What We Do Every Day
Our mission is our daily practice. We come to work to deliver safe, effective service. We enhance our clients productivity. We care for our team and the environment where we work. We measure our success by the trust our clients place in us.

Logistics and Haulage
We transport bulk materials safely across Mpumalanga. Our drivers know the routes. We maintain our trucks to ensure reliable, on time delivery. Our 34-ton side tippers form a core part of this capability, handling over 25,000 tons daily.

Stockpile Management
We manage inventory systems to control quality and supply. Our team has managed over 3,400,000 tons in stockpile volumes. Good stockpile management prevents delays and ensures consistency for our clients.

Mine Rehabilitation
We restore mining land to a productive state. Our work follows careful plans and meets all regulations. We aim to leave the land better than we found it for future use.

Screening, Crushing and Plant Hire
We process raw materials to meet specific client grades. We use mobile plants that we can set up on site. We also hire out this equipment to other operators.

Civil Works
We build strong, durable infrastructure for mines. This includes haul roads, dams, and site facilities. We build things right the first time to avoid problems later.

Soil Stripping
We remove overburden to access resources efficiently. We handle topsoil with care so it can be reused later. This protects the environment while enabling mining.
