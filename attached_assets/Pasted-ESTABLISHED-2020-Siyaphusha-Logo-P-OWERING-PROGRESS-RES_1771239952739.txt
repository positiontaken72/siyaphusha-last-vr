01 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
POWERING PROGRESS SINCE 2020
Four years ago we started with a simple goal. We wanted to be a different
kind of partner in the Mpumalanga mining sector. One that combined real
experience with genuine reliability.
Today, Siyaphusha delivers integrated mining support, earthworks, and logistics from our
base in Phola. We have moved over 1,000,000 tonnes of material for leading industry clients.
We have done this while building a perfect safety record across 30,000 operational hours.
Our clients trust us because we understand the pressure they face. They know we will do what
we say we will do.
A RECORD OF RELIABLE DELIVERY
1M+ TONNES TRANSPORTED WITH OUR HAULAGE FLEET
30k+ OPERATIONAL HOURS WITH ZERO LOST TIME INCIDENTS

02 OUR STORY & VISION
HOW WE BEGAN
Our story is not complicated. Two partners with deep industry experience saw a need for a
contractor who did things properly. In 2020 we established Siyaphusha in Phola. We built
the company on a foundation of hands on knowledge. We believe the best way to run a
project is to understand the work from the ground up.
WHERE WE ARE HEADED
Our vision is clear. We want to be the first company mining and civil clients think of when they
need work done. They should think of us not because we are the largest but because we are the
most dependable. We aim to build partnerships that last for years, not just for one project.
WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY
Our mission is our daily practice. We come to work to deliver safe, effective service. We enhance
our clients productivity. We care for our team and the environment where we work. We measure
our success by the trust our clients place in us.
