AI WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROMPT: SIYAPHUSHA CONSORTIUM

**Project:** Build a production-ready corporate website for **Siyaphusha Consortium (PTY) Ltd**, a South African mining and construction services company based in Mpumalanga.

**Core Mandate:** Create a definitive digital flagship for the South African mining sector. The design must be authoritative, uncluttered, and fast. It should reflect the grit, scale, and forward-thinking nature of the local industry while speaking directly to major clients like Thungela, Glencore, and Transnet.

### **1. DESIGN SYSTEM & GLOBAL RULES**
*   **Color Palette:** Exclusively Black (`#000000`), White (`#FFFFFF`), and Grayscale (`#111111` to `#EEEEEE`). **No accent colors.**
*   **Geometry:** Apply `border-radius: 0;` (sharp 90-degree corners) to **ALL** elements: containers, cards, images, buttons, modals.
*   **Typography:** Use `'Montserrat', sans-serif` for all text. Create hierarchy **only** through font weight (300, 400, 600, 900) and size.
*   **Imagery Style:** Use authentic, high-quality images of South African coal mining operations (e.g., "Mpumalanga earthworks," "Phola coal haulage," "mine rehabilitation Highveld"). **All images must have sharp 90-degree corners** and use `object-fit: cover`.

### **2. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS**

**A. Hero Section (`/src/components/HeroSection.tsx`)**
*   **Background:** Full-viewport, muted, auto-playing video. Source footage of "South African coal mining haul truck fleet" or "Mpumalanga mining landscape aerial view."
*   **Overlay:** Apply a light overlay (`background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`) to slightly lighten the video.
*   **Content (Centered, over video):**
    *   **H1 (Montserrat Black):** "Siyaphusha Consortium"
    *   **H2 (Montserrat SemiBold):** "Building South Africa's Resource Future"
    *   **Subtitle (Montserrat Regular):** "From the heart of Mpumalanga, we deliver expert earthworks, reliable haulage, and responsible mining solutions."
    *   **CTA Buttons:** "View Our Work" | "Partner With Us"

**B. Services Grid (`/src/components/ServicesGrid.tsx`)**
*   **Layout:** A grid displaying **two service cards per row** on desktop. Use `display: grid;` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);` for large screens and `1fr` for mobile.
*   **Card Design:** Each card is a sharp-cornered container. Structure:
    1.  Top: A square, sharp-cornered image relevant to the service.
    2.  Bottom: The service title (in bold) and a one-line description.
*   **Services & Descriptions (Use this exact list):**
    1.  **Mine Rehabilitation:** Restoring land for sustainable future use.
    2.  **Soil Stripping:** Efficient overburden removal to access resources.
    3.  **Civils Works:** Building dams, roads, and essential mine infrastructure.
    4.  **Material Handling:** Safe and precise movement of bulk materials.
    5.  **Screening & Crushing:** Processing raw coal to specified grades.
    6.  **Strategic Stockpile Loading:** Managing inventory for seamless supply.
    7.  **Logistics:** Reliable coal haulage across the Mpumalanga corridor.

**C. Social Responsibility Section (`/src/components/CommunityImpact.tsx`)**
*   **Header:** "OUR COMMUNITY IMPACT" with a subtitle "Investing where we operate."
*   **Component:** Implement an **auto-advancing, horizontal carousel** that shows two large cards per slide.
*   **Card Design:** Sharp-cornered card with:
    1.  A lightened, sharp-cornered image on top.
    2.  A title (e.g., "CHAKALAKA FUTURE STARS").
    3.  A one-line description underneath (e.g., "Empowering Phola's youth through sports sponsorship").
*   **Initial Data:** Populate with the two confirmed initiatives (Chakalaka FC and Early Childhood Development). Structure the component to easily accept more items.

**D. Interactive Route Map (`/src/components/OperationsMap.tsx`)**
*   **Style:** A custom, vector-based map of Mpumalanga with sharp lines.
*   **Data:** Plot these exact coordinates as clickable markers:
    *   Phola Plant: `-26.0560, 29.0172`
    *   Greenside RLT: `-25.9419, 29.1895`
    *   Isibonelo Mine: `-26.4354, 29.2111`
    *   Landau MRD: `-25.9153, 29.1694`
    *   Umsimbithi Mine: `-25.8466, 29.8654`
    *   Zibulo Colliery: `-26.1992, 29.0107`
*   **Interaction:** Clicking a route line opens a sharp-cornered modal with the exact project details (client, scope, volume) from the company profile.

**E. Project Portfolio & Value Calculator**
*   **Portfolio:** Create a filterable gallery of their 6 key projects (including the 3.4M ton Zibulo stockpile management for Thungela).
*   **Calculator Widget:** A tool titled "Plan Your Project."
    *   Input: "Enter tonnage."
    *   Logic: Based on 6 trucks, ~4.5 loads/day, ~43 tons/load.
    *   Output: Displays "Estimated Timeline: X days" and "Daily Volume: Y tons."
